# cache 0.3.0 
 
 - meta:  now uses `.meta` directory
   - cache_create() and cache_find() changed appropriately
 - manifest: now uses `.meta/MANIFEST` file and `manifest_*()` functions.
 - cache/uncache (interactive) and cache_write/cache_read (progromattic) 
   support completely separate use cases.


# cache 0.2.4

 - Add `key` argument to `cache_use_sodium()`
 - Fix `cache_write_rds` so that it doesn't use fs::path_set_ext. That messed 
   with valid R objects with a `.` in the name.

# cache 0.2.3 

 - Fix `uncache`: file extensions work correctly now -- '.' is permitted.

# cache 0.2.2

 - Fix `uncache` to use *sodium* and other generic backends

# cache 0.2.0 

*cache* has been refactored to be more generic in how it handles file types. It
now depends on the fs package and supports RDS and AES formats.
