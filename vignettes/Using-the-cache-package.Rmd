## What is a cache?

A cache is a place to (usually) persistently store objects that can be easily 
and quickly be restored to your working environment.

 * sharable
 * Generally not included as part git repository
 


## If a cache is just a directory, where is it located.

 * If this is a git project, the cache is located in the root of the git projects 
   and cache is added to gitignore 
 * If this is a rpackage project, the cache is {{package_root}}/data
 * If this is neither, the cache is ~/.r-cache
 * user-level cache : ~/.cache
 * share cache:  /path/to/location
 * project level cache 
 
 ## Comparison to other packages
 
  * sqlite
  * df-file
  * etc.
